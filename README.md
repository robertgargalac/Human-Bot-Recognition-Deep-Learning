# Human-Bot-Recognition-Deep-Learning
This is the Deep Learning aproach for this project : https://github.com/robertgargalac/Human-Bot-Response-Recognition

All the details regarding previous work, datasets and other addition info, could be found accesing the link above.

For this time I used Tensorflow for creating a fully-connected neural network.

As features, were used the average of word2vec embedings for response and context, resulting in a 600 elements vector( 300 for response and 300 for context) for each dialogue.
